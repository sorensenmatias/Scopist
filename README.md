# Scoper
Scoper is a lightweight .NET library that makes resolving scoped services simple and type-safe. It provides a generic ScopedResolver&lt;T> for retrieving services from an IServiceScope, ideal for background tasks, hosted services, and other scenarios where constructor injection isnâ€™t possible.
